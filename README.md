To detect the text or symbol on which the finger is pointed, I used a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning. Here's the broader approach:

## Approach:

1. Hand detection:
   - Utilized the camera feed to detect and track the user's hand in real-time.
2. Finger tracking:
   - Once the hand is detected, tracked the movement of the user's index finger within the hand region.
   - Techniques like background differencing and optical flow is used to track finger movement.
3. Text or symbol detection:
   - For OCR, Tesseract library is used which can recognize text from images.
   - [TO DO] For symbol recognition, I may need to create a custom dataset and train a model using techniques like image classification or object detection.
4. Intersection of finger and detected objects:
   - Determined the intersection between the tracked finger position and the detected text or symbols.
   - Calculated the overlap or proximity between the finger's position and the bounding boxes of the recognized objects.
   - Selected the text or symbol with the highest intersection score as the target of the user's finger.
5. Text-to-speech output:
   - Converted the recognized text or symbol into audible speech using text-to-speech (TTS) engine.
   - Made announcement of the selected text or symbol to the user using speakers or headphones connected to the Raspberry Pi.
